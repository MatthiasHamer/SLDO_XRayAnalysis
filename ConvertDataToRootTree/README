compile:

make  

(setup gcc 4.9.3 before, see setup.sh)


usage:
./convert <dose> [path to data directory]


provide the dose like this:
100krad
1.24Mrad

or alike. The script produces a root file with two trees:

LineRegulation:
  -> V_in         Input Voltage in V
  -> I_in         Input Current in A
  -> V_out1       Output Voltage of the Regulator in Shunt-LDO mode in V  
  -> V_out2       Output Voltage of the Regulator in LDO mode in V
  -> Dose         The dose in rad
  
LoadRegulation:
  -> V_in         Input Voltage in V
  -> I_in         Input Current in A
  -> V_out1       Output Voltage of the Regulator in Shunt-LDO mode in V
  -> V_out2       Output Voltage of the Regulator in LDO mode in V
  -> I_Load       Set Load Current for the Shunt-LDO regulator in A
  -> I_Iout       Actual Load Current for the Shunt-LDO regulator in A (should be ~-I_Load)
