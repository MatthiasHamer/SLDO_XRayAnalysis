compile:

make  

(setup gcc 4.9.3 before, see setup.sh)


usage:
./convert <dose> <Vref in mV> <Vofs in mV> [path to data directory]


provide the dose like this:
100krad
1.24Mrad

or alike. The script produces a root file with two trees:

LineRegulation:
  -> Dose         The dose in rad
  -> V_ref        Reference Voltage in V
  -> V_ofs        Offset Voltage in V
  -> V_in         Input Voltage in V
  -> I_in         Input Current in A
  -> V_out        Output Voltage of the Regulator in Shunt-LDO mode in V  
  -> I_Load       Load Current in A
  -> V_Ref_Chip   Reference Voltage as seen by the chip in V
  -> V_Ofs_Chip   Offset Voltage as seen by the chip in V
  -> V_R1         Voltage Drop over the resistor R1 in V
  -> V_Ref_Int    Reference Voltage generated by internal bandgap in V
  
LoadRegulation:
  -> Dose         The dose in rad
  -> V_ref        Reference Voltage in V

  -> I_in         Input Current in A
  -> V_out        Output Voltage in V
  -> I_out        Load Current in A
  -> V_out_SM1    Output Voltage as measured on first load source-meter in V
  -> V_out_SM2    Output Voltage as measured on second load source-meter in V
  -> I_out_SM1    Output Current as measured on first load source-meter in A
  -> I_out_SM2    Output Current as measured on second load source-meter in A
  -> I_out_set    Set output current in A
  -> V_Ref_Chip   Reference Voltage as seen by the chip in V
